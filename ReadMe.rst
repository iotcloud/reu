Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the cloud to perform real time parallel computing on Kinect sensor data recieved from
the TurtlBot. I worked to write code to facilitate streaming raw depth data from the Kinect, convert 
the raw data to distance values, and compres and decompres the values so that they could be sent efficiently.
I also tested the entire system on several measurable factors: compression ratio and time, latency, and bytes sent per second.
My contributions may be seen in detail on the `contributors page <https://github.com/iotcloud/iotrobots/graphs/contributors>`_ for the iotrobots repository.
